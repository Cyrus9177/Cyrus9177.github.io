            <h2>What Makes Me Unique</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond technical skills, I bring a unique combination of creativity and analytical thinking to every project. My experience in both individual and collaborative settings has taught me the importance of clear communication and user-centered design. I don't just write code—I craft solutions that prioritize user experience and practical functionality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My participation in extracurricular activities, from coding clubs to programming competitions, has shaped my ability to work under pressure and think creatively when faced with constraints. I believe that the best developers are lifelong learners, and I embody this philosophy through my continuous pursuit of knowledge and improvement.
